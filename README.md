# Portfolio

## Description
This is a webpage of a portfolio for Dylan Pham, it displays all projects in the future as well as contact details and a about me section.

The motivation for why this webpage was built is in order to showcase my work and skills to potential employers. 
I learnt how to build a portfolio, and the elements that make up a good portfolio, as well as how to structure one.
